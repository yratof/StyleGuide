<hr />

<p>I see my designers using photoshop, that shit has to stop, especially when making style guides for developers and front end guys who don&#8217;t want to open the photoshop.</p>

<p>You dig?</p>

<hr />

<p>Built using <strong>kit</strong> and <strong>scss</strong>, you&#8217;re going to need <a target="_blank" href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a> to be able to use the <strong>kit</strong> files. However, it compiles to <strong>html</strong>, so you might get away with it.</p>
