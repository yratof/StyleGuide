# Boneham & Turner

Mostly built using _.kit_ and _.scss_.

## ITSCSS

So, if you're going to use scss, i've broken down each element into it's own component thing. This way, you can take what you need out and put what you need in.

I've included the _Bourbon_ library with this build, as there are times when I use mixins from it. I'll keep these minimal, and possible remove them all together.

## Dependancies
